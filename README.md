# BGfitness
Hey, I’m Braden Gunn, a current Exercise Science student at Southern Arkansas University and a member of the Mulerider football team. Fitness has always been a part of my life — from early days in athletics to my current journey in sports and exercise science. I created BGFitness to share my knowledge, passion, and personal experience with others who want to get stronger, feel better, and push their limits. Whether you’re new to working out or looking for a reset, this 30-day challenge is designed to help you build real momentum — mentally and physically.
Build Grit. Build Gains. Build You.
